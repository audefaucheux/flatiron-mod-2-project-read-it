sense = Book.create(title: "Sense and Sensibility", synopsis: "This first of Jane Austen's published novels is the story of two starkly different English sisters: Elinor Dashwood, the epitome of prudence and self-control, and her younger, more impetuous sister Marianne, who embodies emotion, openness, and sheer enthusiasm. To each comes the sorrow of unhappy love: Elinor desires a man who is promised to another, while Marianne loses her heart to a scoundrel who jilts her. Their mutual suffering brings a closer understanding between the two sisters--and true love finally triumphs when sense gives way to sensibility and sensibility gives way to sense. Newly designed and typeset in a modern 6-by-9-inch format by Waking Lion Press.", published_date: 2008, author: jane, genre: romance)
